# Employee-Attendance-Analysis-SQL-and-PYTHON-project-


 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data using SQL. The goal is to answer real-world HR and operations questions such as attendance patterns, absenteeism, working hours, and consistency of employees.

This project is ideal for:

* Data Analyst interview preparation
* Practicing SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, WHERE, DATE functions)
* Understanding real business scenarios using raw data

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── employee_attendance.csv   # Raw attendance data
├── attendance.sql            # SQL queries & analysis
├── employee_attendance.ipynb # Python analysis notebook

##  SQL Concepts Used

* `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`
* `JOIN`s
* Date & Time functions
* Conditional logic

---

##  Sample Analysis Questions

* Check for null or missing values in critical columns
* Compare average working hours for **Remote vs Office** employees
* Identify departments where **more than 20% employees** have attendance below 75%
* List employees who consistently work **less than 6 hours**
* Which location (Office/Remote) has higher absenteeism?
* Absent days
* Monthly Attendance Show month-wise attendance percentage for the entire company.
* Identify the months in which an employee's attendance dropped compared to the pervious month
* List employees who were absent 3 days in any single month .
*compare each employee's attendance with department average using window functions.

##  How to Use This Project

### 🔹 Using CSV

1. Open `employee_attendance.csv` to understand the raw data
2. Review columns such as employee_id, date, status, and working hours

### 🔹 Using SQL

1. Import `employee_attendance.csv` into your SQL database
2. Open and run queries from `attendance.sql`
3. Modify queries to explore more insights

### 🔹 Using Python

1. Open `employee_attendance.ipynb`
2. Run the notebook to:

   * Load CSV data
   * Clean and preprocess records
   * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Use Python to validate SQL results

---

##  Learning Outcomes

* Hands-on experience with **CSV → SQL → Python** workflow
* Ability to analyze real-world attendance data
* Improved problem-solving for data analyst interviews
* Understanding when to use SQL vs Python

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Add advanced SQL window functions
* Automate analysis fully using Python
